### Applied Visual Design

**Lock an element to the browser window with Fixed Positioning**

- I had some trouble on the Technical Documentation project page with positioning the navigation bar to the left side of the screen in a fixed position. I am wondering if setting the navigation bar to a fixed position interferes with a media query to change the flex display direction from row(smaller screens) to column(larger screens). I tried different times to get it to work but could not succeed. Ultimately took a different approach but I would like some guidance as to why this may not have worked.
